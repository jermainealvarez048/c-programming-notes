/*
ðŸ§  Project: Bus Fare Calculator
Problem:
A transport company charges fares based on age and distance traveled. The pricing system is as follows:
- Base fare: â‚±10 for the first 5 km
- Additional fare: â‚±2 per km for each kilometer beyond 5 km
Special rates:
- Children below 5 years old ride for free
- Seniors 60 years and older get 20% discount off the total fare

âœ… Requirements:
- Prompt the user to enter:
    - Age
    - Distance traveled in kilometers
- Validate that:
    - Age is a positive integer
    - Distance is at least 1 km
- Compute and display:
    - The base fare
    - The additional fare
    - Total fare before discount
    - Discount (if any)
    - Final fare

ðŸ“¥ Example Input:
Enter age: 65
Enter distance traveled (km): 10

ðŸ“¤ Example Output:
Base fare: â‚±10.00
Additional fare: â‚±10.00
Total before discount: â‚±20.00
Senior discount: â‚±4.00
Final fare: â‚±16.00

ðŸ’¡ Tips:
- Use int or float as needed.
- Youâ€™ll need conditionals (if-else) and maybe the ternary operator.
- Stick to printf formatting to show money nicely, like %.2f.

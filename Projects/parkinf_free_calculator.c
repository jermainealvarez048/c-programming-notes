/*
ðŸ§  Project: Parking Fee Calculator
ðŸš— Situation:
You are building a billing system for a small parking lot. The customer inputs entry and exit times (in 24-hour format), 
and the program computes the parking fee.

âœ… Rules:
- First 2 hours = â‚±40
- Each additional hour or part thereof = â‚±20 per hour
- Maximum charge = â‚±200
- If exit time is earlier than entry time, assume they stayed overnight (crossed midnight)

ðŸ“¥ Input Format:
- Enter entry time (hour and minute): hh mm
- Enter exit time (hour and minute): hh mm
All inputs are integers and in 24-hour format (0â€“23 for hour, 0â€“59 for minute).

ðŸ“¤ Output Example:
Sample Input:
Enter entry time (hh mm): 21 30  
Enter exit time (hh mm): 1 15

Sample Output:
Total parking time: 3 hours, 45 minutes  
Parking fee: â‚±100.00

ðŸ§  How it's calculated:
1. Convert both times into total minutes since midnight
2. Compute duration in minutes
3. Round up to the next full hour
4. Apply the pricing rules
5. Cap fee at â‚±200 if needed

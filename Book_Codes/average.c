/*
The following program reads three numbers and computes their averages, one pair at a time:

Enter three numbers: 3.5 9.6 10.2
Average of 3.5 and 9.6: 6.55
Average of 9.6 and 10.2: 9.9
Average of 3.5 and 10.2: 6.85

Among other things, this program shows that a function can be called as often as we need.
